## 🧾 Overview

**CalculatorLLD** is a structured, modular implementation of a calculator that emphasizes:

* Clean separation of concerns (e.g. parsing, evaluation, command / UI layer)
* Extensibility so that adding new operations or modes is easier
* Maintainability and readability of code
* A base for experimenting with more advanced calculator features (e.g. custom functions, expression trees, plugin operations)

The goal of this repo is not just to “make a calculator” but to show good design practices for such a seemingly simple domain.

## ✔️ Features

Here are expected / implemented features (you can adjust according to what’s actually implemented):

* Basic arithmetic: `+`, `−`, `*`, `/`
* Support for parentheses (grouping)
* Operator precedence
* Handling invalid input / error cases
* Modular architecture: separate components (lexer, parser, evaluator)
* Clean API / command-line interface
* Easily plug in new unary or binary operations

Future / optional features you may want to add:

* Support for functions like `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `log`
* Variables & assignment
* History / undo / redo
* Custom expression definitions
* Interactive shell / REPL interface
* GUI / Web front-end wrapper

## 🏗 Architecture & Design

A suggestions for modular layers (adjust to match your actual code layout):

1. **Lexer / Tokenizer** — Breaks raw input into tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses).
2. **Parser** — Builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) or expression tree based on tokens and grammar.
3. **Evaluator / Interpreter** — Walks the AST to compute result, respecting operator precedence, associativity, etc.
4. **Interface / Driver** — CLI or UI layer that takes user input, calls parser/evaluator, shows output / handles errors.
5. **Extensions / Plugins** — A module or interface for adding new operations or features without touching core.

This layering ensures that UI changes or new operations do not break the core logic.

You can include a UML / class diagram here (if available) to visually show the main modules and their relationships.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* (Optional) Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv)
* Dependencies (if any) listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaZ-dev/CalculatorLLD.git
   cd CalculatorLLD
   ```

2. (Optional) Create & activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux/macOS
   # or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running / Usage

Run the calculator (assuming you have a driver script, e.g. `calculator.py`):

```bash
python calculator.py
```

Then enter expressions, e.g.:

```
> (3 + 4) * 5 - 10 / 2
Result: 30.0
```

You might also support a REPL mode, batch mode (reading from file), or interactive shell.

## 📚 Usage Examples

| Input Expression      | Expected Output   |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `2 + 3 * 4`           | `14`              |
| `(2 + 3) * 4`         | `20`              |
| `10 / (5 - 3)`        | `5`               |
| `5 + 4 - 2 * (8 / 4)` | `3`               |
| `invalid + 5`         | *Error / message* |

Include examples of edge cases / error messages:

* Division by zero
* Malformed parentheses
* Unexpected tokens

---

## 🔧 Extending / Customization

To add a new operation (e.g. power / exponent `^`), you might:

1. Define a new token for `^` in the lexer
2. Update grammar / parser to recognize the new operator with correct precedence
3. Add evaluation logic in the evaluator module
4. Add tests for the new operator

You can also consider:

* Allowing custom user-defined functions
* Plugin architecture where operations are loaded dynamically
* Supporting different numeric types (integers, floats, big integers)

---

## 🧪 Testing

* If you have a `tests/` folder or unit tests, run them via:

  ```bash
  pytest
  # or python -m unittest
  ```

* Test for correctness, edge cases, invalid inputs, performance for large expressions, etc.

* Add tests whenever new features are introduced.
